# scrml-site — hand-off

## Session 0 — repo extraction (2026-06-02, by master PA)

scrml-site was extracted from `scrmlTS/docs/website-viewer/` (21 files, ~244K) into this new sibling repo. inc1 already landed in scrmlTS history at `c66af6b2` (S151) — that work is preserved here verbatim as this repo's initial commit.

Decisions ratified this session (user, via master PA):
- **Repo name:** `scrml-site`
- **scrmlTS relationship:** DEPENDENCY (bun link / published), NOT vendor. Test assets stay in scrmlTS, referenced cross-repo.

## Open carry-forwards for the FIRST scrml-site working session

1. **Wire the scrmlTS dependency.** Set up `scrmlTS` as a `bun link`ed / published dependency so the build + serve use the real compiler (dogfood the adopter path). No vendored copy.
2. **Reconcile README + serve docs.** `README.md` still says `scrml dev docs/website-viewer/` and uses old in-scrmlTS paths. Canonical serve is `bash scripts/serve.sh`. Fix README to this repo's root layout.
3. **Re-verify serve-before-push (S146).** Run `scripts/serve.sh`, confirm the viewer renders + hover-provenance works, before the first push of this repo.
4. **Create the GitHub remote + first push.** Needs the user (GCM can't prompt headlessly). See pa.md → Remote.
5. **inc2 backlog** (see pa.md → C1 carry-forward): 3 more flagships, live dashboard embed, KB-nav, PE-layer toggle, postMessage live-pane↔source hover, Phase-2 HTML/CSS provenance, column-precision highlights. Parked forks: engine-graph multi-file write-loop bug, live-pane mount, dashboard live-embed.

## Cross-repo

- Watch `handOffs/incoming/` for scrmlTS codegen-output-shape-change notices → triggers a provenance-pane rebuild.
- scrmlTS PA will remove the original `docs/website-viewer/` from scrmlTS on master's signal (signal sent 2026-06-02). Confirm it's gone before treating the move as fully atomic.
